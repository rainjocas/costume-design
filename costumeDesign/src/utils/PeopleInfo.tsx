The costumes mirror the fairy/folk tale aesthetic by drawing on the early halloween costumes of the 1920s/30s to evoke a sense of whimsical. These two silhouettes will hopefully evoke a similar era, drawing the costumes together visually despite their distinct color palettes. Both costumes feature winglike features which further emphasize cohesion while also relating to the grander elements of the song through specific references to nature, birds for the “dawn” dancer and moths for the “night” dancer. By referencing grander concepts, I hope that the costumes will also be able to reflect the more intense elements of the song by relating to the grander idea of the coming of the dawn. The piece begins with the “night” dancer along before being joined by the “dawn” dancer, to mimic the rising feeling of the song. Finally, the “night” dancer leaves the “dawn” dancer alone on stage as the music returns to the more whimsical and fanciful melody.",

To me, this piece feels like a fairy tale transformation. Only, rather than the classic rags to riches story, it feels like a re-wilding. I picture it being centered on a single dancer who looks princess-like. This costume is inspired by pre-Raphelite art but will slowly transform over what I’ve deemed the three acts of the dance as the ensemble and second lead first remove parts of the costume before rebuilding it. The ensemble costumes would be inspired by woodland features — part plant and part animal. The second lead dancer is almost prince-like, put hidden behind a mask, similar to that of the ensemble",

        productionName: "The Red Shoes",
        productionStatement: ["Nancy Harris’s The Red Shoes is an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s short story of the same name. It takes inspiration from the frame of the story, a girl who loves dancing, red shoes, a kindly grandmother figure, and an executioner, but twists them to tell a story that feels original. The play follows an orphan, Karen, as she is adopted by a family the Nugents to help the mother, Mariella win a more membership with the “Save the Orphans” foundation. Karen, eager to please, dances for the family, who mocks her for her passion. The parents, Mariella and Bob, treat Karen with disgust and indifference, while their son Clive continually asks if he might cut off Karen’s limbs. In the absence of care from the central family, Karen grows close with Mags, the Nugent’s maid, who allows her to go against Mariella’s wishes to purchase a beautiful pair of red shoes from a legendary shoe maker. Unfortunately, these shoes, while beautiful, force her to dance, throwing her into increasingly large conflicts with the Nugents. After the shoes force Karen to leave Mags for an extended period of time, Mags dies, and Karen desperately tries to remove the shoes. When she is unable to do so, Karen begs Clive to cut off her feet, which he does and immediately regrets. In the aftermath, Karen learns that Mariella was never disgusted by her dancing, but rather jealous of her passion. In the final scene Karen invents a new sort of dance, despite her missing feet.",
                             "I’ve designed costumes for the party scene of this play. After Karen acquires her new shoes, she dances for the Nugents. I’ve chosen to display costumes for the Karen and Clive Nugent, since  their designs are the most striking. This scene also features heightened versions of the character’s  previous costumes, and the Nugents are dressed up. Additionally, the red shoes feature as the center of this scene. All in all, this scene is a performance within a performance, the Nugents attempting to perform a scene of the perfect family. This play feels sort of lost in time. Although the play makes references to Purple Rain, gold iPhones, and Disney, setting this play in the 2012 at the earliest, it doesn’t feel like it wants to be set distinctly in this time. References to Karen being taken to a children’s home by the priest, the deforestation, and traveling shoe makers. There are dozens of references to classic fairy tales — magic mirrors, fairy godmothers, parties in the woods. These feel like they must also be honored. As a result, I’m drawing inspiration from various sources, even if they seem contradictory at times. I want to draw inspiration from the 1920s, as it is often used as a reference for opulence, and is when the strip-tease elements of burlesque began to outweigh the comedic elements. This will be my touchstone, while each individual character will draw from other sources to contribute to the lost in time feeling. Karen will draw from both burlesque dancers and classic fairytale garments. Finally, Clive Nugent will draw on silhouettes from the 1890s and 1910s when fox hunting was  popular."],

For the lovers (and other court humans), I wanted to draw on neo-classical clothing as their story is meant to be set in Greece. Because it has nothing to do with Athens  but more to do with the idea of Athens in Shakespeare’s day, I thought that these Grecian marble inspired silhouettes would make sense for these characters. I plan to keep the lovers in simple and plain characters so that they are more starkly contrasted by the fairies and mechanicals. The fairies will have later 1830s Romantic clothing (with nature inspired hats) that feels over the top and gender bent. Similarly, the Mechanicals will be in 1800s workwear, but with no particular care to gender and bright colors. Overall, I want to draw on historical silhouettes but be creative in terms of gender and fabric choice color!",

        musicStatement: "The first part of this piece really evoked a sense of tranquility in me, but also restlessness. The bright notes and ethereal quality of the sound feel calming, but also light and whimsical. To me this felt very tranquil, and almost reminded me of the color blue. While listening to this part of the song, I felt like I was imagining dancers on stage performing in unison, in a style very close to ballet. Imagining this dance, I was seeing a lot of grace and flowing movement. However, underneath this whole beginning part there is a steady beat, which gradually builds the feeling of restlessness that I talked about. This beat gives the music a sense of moving inexorably forward, especially when it picks up around minute four. Then, around four and a half minutes into the song there is a major shift. The beat turns into the most prominent part of the instrumentation, and it develops an almost heavy metal, or rock feel to it. For me, the emotion shifted dramatically here and began to feel almost frenetic. The dance that I was envisioning in my head was no longer unified and graceful, but more chaotic, with individual dancers doing different things and making it feel like the stage was utterly full of movement. Then, the final stage of the dance, around minute six, evoked a sense of what was almost childhood, with the final notes sounding like a music box, at which point I imagined the dancers slowing down, and gradually coming together again to finish the piece.",

        constructionStatement: "From the name alone, this piece made me think of a book of Russian fairy tales that I loved when I was little–specifically a tale about a mysterious firebird, a prince, and a princess. I mostly based this dance off that story, with some of my own modifications thrown in to fit the musical shifts better. For the prince, Ivan, I wanted heroic, grounded colors, so I chose blue and green. I also wanted to include a nod to the origin of the tale, so the design for Ivan’s shirt is based on traditional Russian dance costumes. For the Firebird, I wanted to convey her otherworldliness and ethereal, mysterious beauty. Her dress will be flowy and flare out with her quick, energetic movement, and also give the illusion of flame with lots of flowing layers of reds, oranges, and yellows. I also have her on pointe to add drama to her choreography. The princess, Katenka, is in purple–for royalty, and to be harmonious with the blue and green in Ivan’s costume–and dark red–to signal her relationship with the Firebird. I want her dress to be much simpler than the Firebird’s but still very beautiful, and she will not be on pointe. This works to show that her beauty comes from her humanity rather than from ethereality.",

        productionName: "Dracula by Kate Hamill",
        productionStatement: ["What drew me to this play most was the playwright’s statement at the beginning of the script. She specifies that the entire ensemble should be clothed in whites and creams, so that splatters of blood can show on the characters. She also has one line at the end of it which I love: The monsters look just like us. I really enjoy the prospect of having a uniform array of light colors at the beginning, and then being able to denote how “polluted” each person gets by the amount of blood they get on them as the play progresses. When the play starts, we aren’t able to tell (by costume at least) who the bad guys are, and we only figure it out once it is too late and the signs have been revealed in bloodshed. Another reason I was excited to design costumes for this play is because it is relatively aperiodic. Of course, the original Dracula has a period in which it was written and set, but this adaptation feels like it could be brought all the way into the modern era if one wished. I loved the idea of being able to decide when I want to place the play.

        finalName: "Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream",
        finalStatement: "I feel like a really big theme in A Midsummer Night’s Dream is wilderness. Most of the show takes place in the woods where the lovers have run away and are being messed with by Puck and Bottom has been cursed. However, once I started thinking about the term “wilderness” I remembered this article that I read a couple of years ago about the romanticism of “wilderness” and how it has perpetuated this myth that humans are separate from nature, and in so doing, fostered a society that allows our irresponsible use of the planet to continue. So then I decided that the focus of my design scheme should be about this myth rather than actual wilderness. But then I was having a hard time figuring out how that translates into clothing. Then I did a little more reading. As it turns out, this myth has been popular since the birth of romanticism, when the qualities of nature (mystery, unknown, foreboding) that had previously made it unapproachable suddenly became desirable. It reached a peak in the United States around the mid-1870s to the 1890s, when the first couple of National Parks were established and Theodore Roosevelt was rising to prominence with his tales of finding himself in the North Dakota wilds. It then continued in our society (and still does to this day) and reached what I would call a second peak around the 1970s, when the EPA was established, and concern for the environment began to rise. So, all of this is really to say that I wanted to situate my design scheme in an era/period that felt particularly relevant to the wilderness myth–and was also exciting and fun for me–and I chose the early 1970s (the EPA was established in 1970).",

        musicStatement: "To me, this song primarily evokes a sense of wonder. It makes sense, as the name translated means “let the sun glow”. In the constant drone at the start of the music, as the subtler tones begin to creep in, it’s a pure world being portrayed. As drums pick up and more instruments join, I see the dancers emerging into this world and exploring it, maybe discovering some of the natural wonder we all lose in the process of growing up as they do. The vocals of the song provide a soft lilt to dance to, reaching for a sun in the dark ‘sky’ of the stage above. The song isn’t very percussive, but much slower and with a steady flow. From that, the dance likely would be in a much softer style than hip-hop, with very purposeful but steady movements. From the high lilting voice and the general reach for wonder, it makes sense as well to envision lifts as part of the dance. As the percussion becomes more intense in the final two minutes the dance can increase in tempo and desperation, grasping for that ethereal something and breaking out of the ways we get stuck living as adults. An increased pace of movement, coordinated towards the same goal, and on the final resounding chord of the song one of the dancers finally is propelled to be able to reach the ‘sun’ and grab hold of it. I hope to make this piece firmly about reclaiming that wonder, even if it means ignoring what we accept as the current natural order.",

        constructionName: "Top Girls by Caryl Churchill",
        constructionStatement: "Top Girls, broadly, is a show that questions modern femininity and success by looking at historical women’s paths to achieving that success. In just the first scene, the audience is introduced to this intersection through the meeting of Marlene and the 6 historical women. In thinking about costuming this show, it feels important to highlight that the show is not trying to educate or examine feminism in historical contexts but instead use that historical information to further highlight the parallels to modern feminism. Since the show means to ask questions about modernity it seems important to try and modernize the costumes, but it is also important that the historical figures do not get too far separated from their original context. Keeping all that in mind, my vision for the costuming of this show is to blend the two while staying true to the essence of each historical character brought up. For Marlene, it must be clear she is a businesswoman. For Isabella, her travels must be clear to the audience. For Lady Nijo, her background is important but her end as a Buddhist nun is more important. For Dull Gret, she must seem like the woman from folklore and the painting brought to the table. For Pope Jean, the masculine dress of modern clergy best captures the essence of her story. For Patient Griselda, she must appear like a woman of noble status. In costuming this show, it’s important to not only properly represent each historical figure but also allow the table of 6 to seem like a complete gathering of distinct people. I hope that by blending a little bit of modern dress into all the costumes as a throughline, they can appear as a cohesive group while still being able to fully deliver on their historical identities.",

        productionName: "Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity by Gustav Holst",
        productionStatement: "While “Jupiter” features a very consistent, almost bouncy tone in it’s composition from the orchestra I feel that part that lends itself most to telling a story is the interplay between the very loud, brassy sections which almost seem to be in conversation with lighter sections played by the flute and triangle. The overall piece feels much like a grand ball, going in and out of waltz tempo as the mood requires. With the more classical sound, this piece can tell a story much like Cinderella, as love is found, lost, sought for again, and ultimately confirmed. It feels inherently grand, being a full orchestra piece. While creating characters from the instruments, it seems obvious that the ‘love interest’ of the fairy tale is represented by the lighter flute parts, many of which echo the recent movements of the bigger brass section which can then be the voice of both the ‘prince’ and the royal court. Additionally, there is a bridge between these two sections in the form of a recurring trumpet part which can be both a ‘narrator’ of sorts and an aide of the royals, being a brass instrument. With the many echoes between the light and heavy parts, the story can switch perspectives between the runaway lover and the prince in pursuit, while also cutting back to the royal court in uproar occasionally. Being a dance, the story won’t be told in words but in motions. This means a lot of more ‘classical’ styles of dance, likely mixing ballet, ballroom, and waltzes as the song switches tempo and tone. For costumes, maximizing movement is of course important but being able to create flow as well through longer, ballgown style dresses (or slightly modified tutus for ballet sections) as well as longer capes for the male roles would allow greater life within the piece.",

From Peter Brook’s one white room production in 1970 to Julie Taymor’s maximalist 2013 production, there’s so much room in the text to do what you want. What I see in reading this text is the wildness of the fae juxtaposed against the ‘civility’ of the Athenians, even as the Athenians deny love and the fae are the invisible hand that work to bring it together. In staging this, I want distinctly animalistic elements to be part of the costume of every fae and faerie, from fangs to tails to ears to claws maybe, lots of fur and hooves for Puck at the least if nobody else. They will be regal, but regal in the way a wild beast rules an area instead of the royal presence granted by law among humans. For the Athenians, I perhaps took Athenian too literally but I see them in togas. Royal purple, loose fitting robes with gold and silver trim for those in high positions. Their servants may be dressed in much simpler cloth, perhaps even a shirt and pants, but distinctly not modern. Blurring the line slightly on modernity, I want Bottom’s mechanicals to have modern tools that let the audience very easily pick up on their professions. I want their work to be part of their costume, layered over an otherwise simple base that gets increasingly covered as they stray further and further from their mundane reality into the worlds of both the play and the fae, gaining colorful costume pieces and perhaps even masks.",

The color effects and character designs also invoke one of the most important characteristics of Batman comics and their history- camp. Character costumes within Bruce’s mind are more a reflection of Bruce’s perception of them than of their own characters, and invoke bat elements as a reference to his psyche. Although bruce himself is acting as a doctor, he  is dressed in elements of the Batman suit, like a kid playing dress up. After all, this is nothing but a fantasy. Characters outside of Bruce’s mind, like Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)  use colors closer to the norm, which helps to clue in the audience that what is happening is not reality.",

There are many different colors ascribed to faeries in Welsh folklore, depending on the type of faerie, and the region of the myth. For example the “the old elves of the blue petticoat”, the “Green Lady of Caerphilly” who is a goblin character, and the fairies of Frennifawr who dressed in red. However the most common color for faeries in welsh folklore seems to be white. Blue, green, red, and especially white will be the colors of the fairies. In particular, Puck will be dressed in green like the Green Lady of Caerphilly and Titania will be dressed in many layers of white. Stories about fairies in particular often place them as gone but very recent past. However, the age of fairies is typically placed around the same time as the Arthurian legends, which are said to have occured in the 5th-6th century. Because of this, I will be placing the fairies in 5th century Celtic dress. Additionally folklore inherently has a sense of timelessness, so I would like to place the mortals in the 15th-17th century, as a point of contrast against the fairies.",

            "With these ideas in mind, I wanted to make a dress inspired by what was worn rural Kentucky/ coal country in this time period that would later transform into a beautiful cotillion gown. For the end of the piece, I wanted the two dresses to come together to make a new one, representing how the main character took agency for herself in what she wanted to wear, instead of conforming to the expectations of the cotillion ball.I also wanted to create a character that would be similar to the birds in cinderella, who would be able to help her out throughout the piece, especially with getting in and out of the costume.",
            "As of right now I still need to choose a direction for what my third costume would be, but I think it will likely be one of the men at the ball, or another girl who she may meet outside and befriend."],

        finalStatement: [
            "A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a show that incorporates a lot of diverse aspects usually seen in fantasy fiction, such as the usage of historical language, the presence of non human characters, particularly fairies, and the usage of various forms of magic to forward the plot.",
            "For this reason I took heavy inspiration from the world of Magic the Gathering for my interpretation of this show, due to the many fantastical worlds explored in it’s lore, and the card’s artworks. I tried my best to separate the characters in a Midsummer Night’s dream in to the different color and creature archetypes present in Magic the Gathering. The most obvious example of which is basing many of the fairy characters off of the Faerie creatures in MTG, which tend to be blue due to their nature as tricksters, or green due to their attachment to nature. In addition to this I inspired the lover characters off of  humans and elves, typically white and green respectively, due both to their species and their association with love and marriage in the play, as most cards relating to marriage and love are white. I took inspiration from the Boros (red/white) archetype for characters such as Theseus, who is a leader and warrior, as the Boros clan is heavily associated with these characteristics. I also attempted to incorporate design elements from Orzhov (black/white) for characters that are depicted as controlling and selfish, such as Egeus, for similar reasons. For the Players, I took inspiration from red creatures in the game, as these tend to be the most heavily associated with sporiety, spontaneity, and working in fields such as metallurgy. I also took heavy inspiration from many green cards, as the majority of this play takes place in the forest, and green cards are evidently heavily associated with nature.",
            "I generally tried as well to demonstrate specific characteristics of the characters in their outfits, while keeping true to the fantasy vibe I was going for. For example, I chose to make demetrius more obnoxious looking by emphasising his wealth in his outfit, and I tried to emphasize Helena’s obsession with beauty by portraying her in an elegant robe and with lots of jewelry. On the other hand I wanted to portray Lysander and Hermia both as more independent, so I gave them less stuffy/ constricting clothes, and more personality through the inclusion of shapes as patterns throughout their outfits.",
            "I chose to keep my inspiration pictures to mostly older magic cards the best I could, as the game more recently has been portraying more futuristic/ technological worlds, which isn’t consistent with the more high fantasy vibe I want to portray with this show."],

        musicStatement: "'Threads' starts slowly with a consistent rhythm and gentle guitar. The slowness and deep chords create an earthy feel with the notes flowing into one another. This pushed me to select floral patterns, and muted, natural colors for the costumes. The prolonged nature of each chord inspired me to design costumes that would flow with the movements of the dancers, both fast and slow. As a result, I decided on long, multi-layered skirts with floral patterns as I thought they’d represent the movement and earthiness of the song. This is further emphasized by the loose crochet sleeves added to each dancer's costume as they shift with their movements. The costume doesn’t include shoes because I feel that this look captures the song’s informal nature. Additionally, both dancers are depicted with simple hairstyles that allow movement. Through this emphasis on the flowing nature of the costumes, I worked to create an earthy feel and a sense of connectedness between the dancers and their movements.",

        constructionStatement: "Act I of Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls depicts a celebratory dinner for Marlene attended by some of her closest friends: historical, female figures. The scene has a New York City essence, and I couldn’t help but think of Sex and The City as I read these women, close female friends, as they drink wine and talk over one another in a smoky steakhouse. Throughout the scene, the figures tell stories of their lives, many including a lack of choice/consent and painful interactions with men. To counteract this sense of powerlessness in parts of their stories, I want their costumes to give them autonomy and embrace sexuality while being reminiscent of their time periods and geographic origins. Since all of the characters other than Marlene are deceased, I want their costumes to reflect versions of themselves in the afterlife. More glamorous and almost angelic, to give them an otherworldly feel, while still fitting into the setting. To help them fit in, I want each of their outfits to be modern, with small pieces that reflect the stories of their lives.",

        productionName: "Waters of March - Art Garfunkel",
        productionStatement: "Garfunkel’s song, “Waters of March,” illustrates the late winter mood as we anticipate the coming of spring. The song is characterized by spoken words and a consistent beat that is marked by staccato guitar chords. These short chords are reminiscent of typing, bringing to mind a fluorescently lit grey office. Similarly, I am reminded of the weather of February and March as the snow becomes grey and brown on the side of the road and clouds fill the sky. However, after each chorus, a synth interlude plays, contrasting with the mundane quality of the verses. Each time, it is queued by a slight variation of Garfunkel’s words, “and the riverbank talks of the waters of March, it’s the end of the strain, it’s the joy in your heart.” To me, these interludes represent glimmers of spring as the uplifting lyrics contrast with the bland lists that fill the verses. These short moments of contrast within the song bring to mind costumes that represent the greys of late winter and the sharpness of staccato notes versus those that represent the glimmering waters and colorful hues of spring.",

As I read the play over the past week, I have been imagining formal Prom attire that encapsulate the characters and motifs in the play as they change throughout the story. I absolutely loved the mystical and humorous nature of the play as depicted through fairies, magical flowers, and ominous woods. I want the designed Prom outfits to be a bit over-the-top to fully grasp this sense of magic. To do so, I plan to draw design inspiration from red-carpet formal wear. While translating Shakespeare’s depiction of magic, I want to draw pieces from his other works, specifically Romeo and Juliet, drawing similarities between his leading female characters, Hermia and Juliet.",
