        productionStatement: "The chosen piece is the first episode of the podcast Batman Unburied. It takes place almost entirely in Bruce Wayne (Batman’s) own mind. This disconnect from reality is demonstrated by the valueizing color designs of old black and white films, invoking the black and white origins of the characters in comics. The color effects and character designs also invoke one of the most important characteristics of Batman comics and their history- camp. Character costumes within Bruce’s mind are more a reflection of Bruce’s perception of them than of their own characters, and invoke bat elements as a reference to his psyche. Although bruce himself is acting as a doctor, he  is dressed in elements of the Batman suit, like a kid playing dress up. After all, this is nothing but a fantasy. Characters outside of Bruce’s mind, like Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)  use colors closer to the norm, which helps to clue in the audience that what is happening is not reality.",

        finalStatement: "Although England has its own folklore surrounding fairies, Shakespeare’s fairies share more commonalities with those from Welsh folklore.  There are many different colors ascribed to faeries in Welsh folklore, depending on the type of faerie, and the region of the myth. For example the “the old elves of the blue petticoat”, the “Green Lady of Caerphilly” who is a goblin character, and the fairies of Frennifawr who dressed in red. However the most common color for faeries in welsh folklore seems to be white. Blue, green, red, and especially white will be the colors of the fairies. In particular, Puck will be dressed in green like the Green Lady of Caerphilly and Titania will be dressed in many layers of white. Stories about fairies in particular often place them as gone but very recent past. However, the age of fairies is typically placed around the same time as the Arthurian legends, which are said to have occured in the 5th-6th century. Because of this, I will be placing the fairies in 5th century Celtic dress. Additionally folklore inherently has a sense of timelessness, so I would like to place the mortals in the 15th-17th century, as a point of contrast against the fairies.",

            "For this piece I was really inspired by old disney cartoons, as the music reminded me of the kind of songs that would be played in the background of one of these movies. The music also reminded me of ballroom dancing at certain points, and it also seemed to have a lot of moments of conflict in it that I wanted to represent through the story in my costumes",
            "The biggest starting off point for this project was the movie Cinderella, as I imagined the song as being the backing track to a dance about a Cinderella type story, where a young girl wants to go to the ball, gets thwarted, eventually makes it there, but ultimately realizes the whole thing isn’t really for her. Given the time period the early disney were made in (~1940s/50s) for the ball aspect I took inspiration from my grandmother, who took part in the cotillion when she was a young girl in Kentucky.",
            "With these ideas in mind, I wanted to make a dress inspired by what was worn rural Kentucky/ coal country in this time period that would later transform into a beautiful cotillion gown. For the end of the piece, I wanted the two dresses to come together to make a new one, representing how the main character took agency for herself in what she wanted to wear, instead of conforming to the expectations of the cotillion ball.I also wanted to create a character that would be similar to the birds in cinderella, who would be able to help her out throughout the piece, especially with getting in and out of the costume.",
            "As of right now I still need to choose a direction for what my third costume would be, but I think it will likely be one of the men at the ball, or another girl who she may meet outside and befriend."],

            "A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a show that incorporates a lot of diverse aspects usually seen in fantasy fiction, such as the usage of historical language, the presence of non human characters, particularly fairies, and the usage of various forms of magic to forward the plot.",
            "For this reason I took heavy inspiration from the world of Magic the Gathering for my interpretation of this show, due to the many fantastical worlds explored in it’s lore, and the card’s artworks. I tried my best to separate the characters in a Midsummer Night’s dream in to the different color and creature archetypes present in Magic the Gathering. The most obvious example of which is basing many of the fairy characters off of the Faerie creatures in MTG, which tend to be blue due to their nature as tricksters, or green due to their attachment to nature. In addition to this I inspired the lover characters off of  humans and elves, typically white and green respectively, due both to their species and their association with love and marriage in the play, as most cards relating to marriage and love are white. I took inspiration from the Boros (red/white) archetype for characters such as Theseus, who is a leader and warrior, as the Boros clan is heavily associated with these characteristics. I also attempted to incorporate design elements from Orzhov (black/white) for characters that are depicted as controlling and selfish, such as Egeus, for similar reasons. For the Players, I took inspiration from red creatures in the game, as these tend to be the most heavily associated with sporiety, spontaneity, and working in fields such as metallurgy. I also took heavy inspiration from many green cards, as the majority of this play takes place in the forest, and green cards are evidently heavily associated with nature.",
            "I generally tried as well to demonstrate specific characteristics of the characters in their outfits, while keeping true to the fantasy vibe I was going for. For example, I chose to make demetrius more obnoxious looking by emphasising his wealth in his outfit, and I tried to emphasize Helena’s obsession with beauty by portraying her in an elegant robe and with lots of jewelry. On the other hand I wanted to portray Lysander and Hermia both as more independent, so I gave them less stuffy/ constricting clothes, and more personality through the inclusion of shapes as patterns throughout their outfits.",
            "I chose to keep my inspiration pictures to mostly older magic cards the best I could, as the game more recently has been portraying more futuristic/ technological worlds, which isn’t consistent with the more high fantasy vibe I want to portray with this show."],
