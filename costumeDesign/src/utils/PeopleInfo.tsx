        musicStatement: "To me, this song primarily evokes a sense of wonder. It makes sense, as the name translated means “let the sun glow”. In the constant drone at the start of the music, as the subtler tones begin to creep in, it’s a pure world being portrayed. As drums pick up and more instruments join, I see the dancers emerging into this world and exploring it, maybe discovering some of the natural wonder we all lose in the process of growing up as they do. The vocals of the song provide a soft lilt to dance to, reaching for a sun in the dark ‘sky’ of the stage above. The song isn’t very percussive, but much slower and with a steady flow. From that, the dance likely would be in a much softer style than hip-hop, with very purposeful but steady movements. From the high lilting voice and the general reach for wonder, it makes sense as well to envision lifts as part of the dance. As the percussion becomes more intense in the final two minutes the dance can increase in tempo and desperation, grasping for that ethereal something and breaking out of the ways we get stuck living as adults. An increased pace of movement, coordinated towards the same goal, and on the final resounding chord of the song one of the dancers finally is propelled to be able to reach the ‘sun’ and grab hold of it. I hope to make this piece firmly about reclaiming that wonder, even if it means ignoring what we accept as the current natural order.",

        constructionName: "Top Girls by Caryl Churchill",
        constructionStatement: "Top Girls, broadly, is a show that questions modern femininity and success by looking at historical women’s paths to achieving that success. In just the first scene, the audience is introduced to this intersection through the meeting of Marlene and the 6 historical women. In thinking about costuming this show, it feels important to highlight that the show is not trying to educate or examine feminism in historical contexts but instead use that historical information to further highlight the parallels to modern feminism. Since the show means to ask questions about modernity it seems important to try and modernize the costumes, but it is also important that the historical figures do not get too far separated from their original context. Keeping all that in mind, my vision for the costuming of this show is to blend the two while staying true to the essence of each historical character brought up. For Marlene, it must be clear she is a businesswoman. For Isabella, her travels must be clear to the audience. For Lady Nijo, her background is important but her end as a Buddhist nun is more important. For Dull Gret, she must seem like the woman from folklore and the painting brought to the table. For Pope Jean, the masculine dress of modern clergy best captures the essence of her story. For Patient Griselda, she must appear like a woman of noble status. In costuming this show, it’s important to not only properly represent each historical figure but also allow the table of 6 to seem like a complete gathering of distinct people. I hope that by blending a little bit of modern dress into all the costumes as a throughline, they can appear as a cohesive group while still being able to fully deliver on their historical identities.",

        productionName: "Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity by Gustav Holst",
        productionStatement: "While “Jupiter” features a very consistent, almost bouncy tone in it’s composition from the orchestra I feel that part that lends itself most to telling a story is the interplay between the very loud, brassy sections which almost seem to be in conversation with lighter sections played by the flute and triangle. The overall piece feels much like a grand ball, going in and out of waltz tempo as the mood requires. With the more classical sound, this piece can tell a story much like Cinderella, as love is found, lost, sought for again, and ultimately confirmed. It feels inherently grand, being a full orchestra piece. While creating characters from the instruments, it seems obvious that the ‘love interest’ of the fairy tale is represented by the lighter flute parts, many of which echo the recent movements of the bigger brass section which can then be the voice of both the ‘prince’ and the royal court. Additionally, there is a bridge between these two sections in the form of a recurring trumpet part which can be both a ‘narrator’ of sorts and an aide of the royals, being a brass instrument. With the many echoes between the light and heavy parts, the story can switch perspectives between the runaway lover and the prince in pursuit, while also cutting back to the royal court in uproar occasionally. Being a dance, the story won’t be told in words but in motions. This means a lot of more ‘classical’ styles of dance, likely mixing ballet, ballroom, and waltzes as the song switches tempo and tone. For costumes, maximizing movement is of course important but being able to create flow as well through longer, ballgown style dresses (or slightly modified tutus for ballet sections) as well as longer capes for the male roles would allow greater life within the piece.",

        finalName: "A Midsummer Nights Dream - Back to the Classics",
        finalStatement: "A Midsummer Night’s Dream is one of Shakespeare’s best known comedies, but also well know for the wide range of ways it has been produced. From Peter Brook’s one white room production in 1970 to Julie Taymor’s maximalist 2013 production, there’s so much room in the text to do what you want. What I see in reading this text is the wildness of the fae juxtaposed against the ‘civility’ of the Athenians, even as the Athenians deny love and the fae are the invisible hand that work to bring it together. In staging this, I want distinctly animalistic elements to be part of the costume of every fae and faerie, from fangs to tails to ears to claws maybe, lots of fur and hooves for Puck at the least if nobody else. They will be regal, but regal in the way a wild beast rules an area instead of the royal presence granted by law among humans. For the Athenians, I perhaps took Athenian too literally but I see them in togas. Royal purple, loose fitting robes with gold and silver trim for those in high positions. Their servants may be dressed in much simpler cloth, perhaps even a shirt and pants, but distinctly not modern. Blurring the line slightly on modernity, I want Bottom’s mechanicals to have modern tools that let the audience very easily pick up on their professions. I want their work to be part of their costume, layered over an otherwise simple base that gets increasingly covered as they stray further and further from their mundane reality into the worlds of both the play and the fae, gaining colorful costume pieces and perhaps even masks.",

This disconnect from reality is demonstrated by the valueizing color designs of old black and white films, invoking the black and white origins of the characters in comics. The color effects and character designs also invoke one of the most important characteristics of Batman comics and their history- camp. Character costumes within Bruce’s mind are more a reflection of Bruce’s perception of them than of their own characters, and invoke bat elements as a reference to his psyche. Although bruce himself is acting as a doctor, he  is dressed in elements of the Batman suit, like a kid playing dress up. After all, this is nothing but a fantasy. Characters outside of Bruce’s mind, like Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)  use colors closer to the norm, which helps to clue in the audience that what is happening is not reality.",

        finalStatement: "Although England has its own folklore surrounding fairies, Shakespeare’s fairies share more commonalities with those from Welsh folklore.  There are many different colors ascribed to faeries in Welsh folklore, depending on the type of faerie, and the region of the myth. For example the “the old elves of the blue petticoat”, the “Green Lady of Caerphilly” who is a goblin character, and the fairies of Frennifawr who dressed in red. However the most common color for faeries in welsh folklore seems to be white. Blue, green, red, and especially white will be the colors of the fairies. In particular, Puck will be dressed in green like the Green Lady of Caerphilly and Titania will be dressed in many layers of white. Stories about fairies in particular often place them as gone but very recent past. However, the age of fairies is typically placed around the same time as the Arthurian legends, which are said to have occured in the 5th-6th century. Because of this, I will be placing the fairies in 5th century Celtic dress. Additionally folklore inherently has a sense of timelessness, so I would like to place the mortals in the 15th-17th century, as a point of contrast against the fairies.",

The music also reminded me of ballroom dancing at certain points, and it also seemed to have a lot of moments of conflict in it that I wanted to represent through the story in my costumes",
            "The biggest starting off point for this project was the movie Cinderella, as I imagined the song as being the backing track to a dance about a Cinderella type story, where a young girl wants to go to the ball, gets thwarted, eventually makes it there, but ultimately realizes the whole thing isn’t really for her. Given the time period the early disney were made in (~1940s/50s) for the ball aspect I took inspiration from my grandmother, who took part in the cotillion when she was a young girl in Kentucky.",
            "With these ideas in mind, I wanted to make a dress inspired by what was worn rural Kentucky/ coal country in this time period that would later transform into a beautiful cotillion gown. For the end of the piece, I wanted the two dresses to come together to make a new one, representing how the main character took agency for herself in what she wanted to wear, instead of conforming to the expectations of the cotillion ball.I also wanted to create a character that would be similar to the birds in cinderella, who would be able to help her out throughout the piece, especially with getting in and out of the costume.",

            "A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a show that incorporates a lot of diverse aspects usually seen in fantasy fiction, such as the usage of historical language, the presence of non human characters, particularly fairies, and the usage of various forms of magic to forward the plot.",
            "For this reason I took heavy inspiration from the world of Magic the Gathering for my interpretation of this show, due to the many fantastical worlds explored in it’s lore, and the card’s artworks. I tried my best to separate the characters in a Midsummer Night’s dream in to the different color and creature archetypes present in Magic the Gathering. The most obvious example of which is basing many of the fairy characters off of the Faerie creatures in MTG, which tend to be blue due to their nature as tricksters, or green due to their attachment to nature. In addition to this I inspired the lover characters off of  humans and elves, typically white and green respectively, due both to their species and their association with love and marriage in the play, as most cards relating to marriage and love are white. I took inspiration from the Boros (red/white) archetype for characters such as Theseus, who is a leader and warrior, as the Boros clan is heavily associated with these characteristics. I also attempted to incorporate design elements from Orzhov (black/white) for characters that are depicted as controlling and selfish, such as Egeus, for similar reasons. For the Players, I took inspiration from red creatures in the game, as these tend to be the most heavily associated with sporiety, spontaneity, and working in fields such as metallurgy. I also took heavy inspiration from many green cards, as the majority of this play takes place in the forest, and green cards are evidently heavily associated with nature.",
            "I generally tried as well to demonstrate specific characteristics of the characters in their outfits, while keeping true to the fantasy vibe I was going for. For example, I chose to make demetrius more obnoxious looking by emphasising his wealth in his outfit, and I tried to emphasize Helena’s obsession with beauty by portraying her in an elegant robe and with lots of jewelry. On the other hand I wanted to portray Lysander and Hermia both as more independent, so I gave them less stuffy/ constricting clothes, and more personality through the inclusion of shapes as patterns throughout their outfits.",
            "I chose to keep my inspiration pictures to mostly older magic cards the best I could, as the game more recently has been portraying more futuristic/ technological worlds, which isn’t consistent with the more high fantasy vibe I want to portray with this show."],

This pushed me to select floral patterns, and muted, natural colors for the costumes. The prolonged nature of each chord inspired me to design costumes that would flow with the movements of the dancers, both fast and slow. As a result, I decided on long, multi-layered skirts with floral patterns as I thought they’d represent the movement and earthiness of the song. This is further emphasized by the loose crochet sleeves added to each dancer's costume as they shift with their movements. The costume doesn’t include shoes because I feel that this look captures the song’s informal nature. Additionally, both dancers are depicted with simple hairstyles that allow movement. Through this emphasis on the flowing nature of the costumes, I worked to create an earthy feel and a sense of connectedness between the dancers and their movements.",

Throughout the scene, the figures tell stories of their lives, many including a lack of choice/consent and painful interactions with men. To counteract this sense of powerlessness in parts of their stories, I want their costumes to give them autonomy and embrace sexuality while being reminiscent of their time periods and geographic origins. Since all of the characters other than Marlene are deceased, I want their costumes to reflect versions of themselves in the afterlife.

The song is characterized by spoken words and a consistent beat that is marked by staccato guitar chords. These short chords are reminiscent of typing, bringing to mind a fluorescently lit grey office. Similarly, I am reminded of the weather of February and March as the snow becomes grey and brown on the side of the road and clouds fill the sky. However, after each chorus, a synth interlude plays, contrasting with the mundane quality of the verses. Each time, it is queued by a slight variation of Garfunkel’s words, “and the riverbank talks of the waters of March, it’s the end of the strain, it’s the joy in your heart.” To me, these interludes represent glimmers of spring as the uplifting lyrics contrast with the bland lists that fill the verses. These short moments of contrast within the song bring to mind costumes that represent the greys of late winter and the sharpness of staccato notes versus those that represent the glimmering waters and colorful hues of spring.",
