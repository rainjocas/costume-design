This disconnect from reality is demonstrated by the valueizing color designs of old black and white films, invoking the black and white origins of the characters in comics. The color effects and character designs also invoke one of the most important characteristics of Batman comics and their history- camp. Character costumes within Bruce’s mind are more a reflection of Bruce’s perception of them than of their own characters, and invoke bat elements as a reference to his psyche. Although bruce himself is acting as a doctor, he  is dressed in elements of the Batman suit, like a kid playing dress up. After all, this is nothing but a fantasy. Characters outside of Bruce’s mind, like Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)  use colors closer to the norm, which helps to clue in the audience that what is happening is not reality.",

        finalStatement: "Although England has its own folklore surrounding fairies, Shakespeare’s fairies share more commonalities with those from Welsh folklore.  There are many different colors ascribed to faeries in Welsh folklore, depending on the type of faerie, and the region of the myth. For example the “the old elves of the blue petticoat”, the “Green Lady of Caerphilly” who is a goblin character, and the fairies of Frennifawr who dressed in red. However the most common color for faeries in welsh folklore seems to be white. Blue, green, red, and especially white will be the colors of the fairies. In particular, Puck will be dressed in green like the Green Lady of Caerphilly and Titania will be dressed in many layers of white. Stories about fairies in particular often place them as gone but very recent past. However, the age of fairies is typically placed around the same time as the Arthurian legends, which are said to have occured in the 5th-6th century. Because of this, I will be placing the fairies in 5th century Celtic dress. Additionally folklore inherently has a sense of timelessness, so I would like to place the mortals in the 15th-17th century, as a point of contrast against the fairies.",

The music also reminded me of ballroom dancing at certain points, and it also seemed to have a lot of moments of conflict in it that I wanted to represent through the story in my costumes",
            "The biggest starting off point for this project was the movie Cinderella, as I imagined the song as being the backing track to a dance about a Cinderella type story, where a young girl wants to go to the ball, gets thwarted, eventually makes it there, but ultimately realizes the whole thing isn’t really for her. Given the time period the early disney were made in (~1940s/50s) for the ball aspect I took inspiration from my grandmother, who took part in the cotillion when she was a young girl in Kentucky.",
            "With these ideas in mind, I wanted to make a dress inspired by what was worn rural Kentucky/ coal country in this time period that would later transform into a beautiful cotillion gown. For the end of the piece, I wanted the two dresses to come together to make a new one, representing how the main character took agency for herself in what she wanted to wear, instead of conforming to the expectations of the cotillion ball.I also wanted to create a character that would be similar to the birds in cinderella, who would be able to help her out throughout the piece, especially with getting in and out of the costume.",

            "For this reason I took heavy inspiration from the world of Magic the Gathering for my interpretation of this show, due to the many fantastical worlds explored in it’s lore, and the card’s artworks. I tried my best to separate the characters in a Midsummer Night’s dream in to the different color and creature archetypes present in Magic the Gathering. The most obvious example of which is basing many of the fairy characters off of the Faerie creatures in MTG, which tend to be blue due to their nature as tricksters, or green due to their attachment to nature. In addition to this I inspired the lover characters off of  humans and elves, typically white and green respectively, due both to their species and their association with love and marriage in the play, as most cards relating to marriage and love are white. I took inspiration from the Boros (red/white) archetype for characters such as Theseus, who is a leader and warrior, as the Boros clan is heavily associated with these characteristics. I also attempted to incorporate design elements from Orzhov (black/white) for characters that are depicted as controlling and selfish, such as Egeus, for similar reasons. For the Players, I took inspiration from red creatures in the game, as these tend to be the most heavily associated with sporiety, spontaneity, and working in fields such as metallurgy. I also took heavy inspiration from many green cards, as the majority of this play takes place in the forest, and green cards are evidently heavily associated with nature.",
            "I generally tried as well to demonstrate specific characteristics of the characters in their outfits, while keeping true to the fantasy vibe I was going for. For example, I chose to make demetrius more obnoxious looking by emphasising his wealth in his outfit, and I tried to emphasize Helena’s obsession with beauty by portraying her in an elegant robe and with lots of jewelry. On the other hand I wanted to portray Lysander and Hermia both as more independent, so I gave them less stuffy/ constricting clothes, and more personality through the inclusion of shapes as patterns throughout their outfits.",

        musicName: "Threads - This Will Destroy You",
        musicStatement: "'Threads' starts slowly with a consistent rhythm and gentle guitar. The slowness and deep chords create an earthy feel with the notes flowing into one another. This pushed me to select floral patterns, and muted, natural colors for the costumes. The prolonged nature of each chord inspired me to design costumes that would flow with the movements of the dancers, both fast and slow. As a result, I decided on long, multi-layered skirts with floral patterns as I thought they’d represent the movement and earthiness of the song. This is further emphasized by the loose crochet sleeves added to each dancer's costume as they shift with their movements. The costume doesn’t include shoes because I feel that this look captures the song’s informal nature. Additionally, both dancers are depicted with simple hairstyles that allow movement. Through this emphasis on the flowing nature of the costumes, I worked to create an earthy feel and a sense of connectedness between the dancers and their movements.",

        constructionStatement: "Act I of Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls depicts a celebratory dinner for Marlene attended by some of her closest friends: historical, female figures. The scene has a New York City essence, and I couldn’t help but think of Sex and The City as I read these women, close female friends, as they drink wine and talk over one another in a smoky steakhouse. Throughout the scene, the figures tell stories of their lives, many including a lack of choice/consent and painful interactions with men. To counteract this sense of powerlessness in parts of their stories, I want their costumes to give them autonomy and embrace sexuality while being reminiscent of their time periods and geographic origins. Since all of the characters other than Marlene are deceased, I want their costumes to reflect versions of themselves in the afterlife. More glamorous and almost angelic, to give them an otherworldly feel, while still fitting into the setting. To help them fit in, I want each of their outfits to be modern, with small pieces that reflect the stories of their lives.",

        productionName: "Waters of March - Art Garfunkel",
        productionStatement: "Garfunkel’s song, “Waters of March,” illustrates the late winter mood as we anticipate the coming of spring. The song is characterized by spoken words and a consistent beat that is marked by staccato guitar chords. These short chords are reminiscent of typing, bringing to mind a fluorescently lit grey office. Similarly, I am reminded of the weather of February and March as the snow becomes grey and brown on the side of the road and clouds fill the sky. However, after each chorus, a synth interlude plays, contrasting with the mundane quality of the verses. Each time, it is queued by a slight variation of Garfunkel’s words, “and the riverbank talks of the waters of March, it’s the end of the strain, it’s the joy in your heart.” To me, these interludes represent glimmers of spring as the uplifting lyrics contrast with the bland lists that fill the verses. These short moments of contrast within the song bring to mind costumes that represent the greys of late winter and the sharpness of staccato notes versus those that represent the glimmering waters and colorful hues of spring.",

        finalStatement: "The day after receiving this assignment, my high school announced that their theme for this year’s prom would be “A Midsummer Night’s Dream. As I read the play over the past week, I have been imagining formal Prom attire that encapsulate the characters and motifs in the play as they change throughout the story. I absolutely loved the mystical and humorous nature of the play as depicted through fairies, magical flowers, and ominous woods. I want the designed Prom outfits to be a bit over-the-top to fully grasp this sense of magic. To do so, I plan to draw design inspiration from red-carpet formal wear. While translating Shakespeare’s depiction of magic, I want to draw pieces from his other works, specifically Romeo and Juliet, drawing similarities between his leading female characters, Hermia and Juliet.",
